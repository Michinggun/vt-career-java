A complement of a number is defined as inversion (if the bit value = 0, change it to 1 and vice-versa) of all bits of the number starting from the leftmost bit that is set to 1. 

For example, if N = 5, N is 101 in binary. The complement of N is 010, which is 2 in decimal. Similarly if N = 50, then complement of N is 13 Complete the function getIntegerComplement(). This function takes N as it's parameter. The function should return the complement of N.
Constraints : 0 ≤ N ≤ 100000. Sample Test Cases: 

Input #00: 50 
Output #00: 13
Explanation: 50 in decimal form equals: 110010. Inverting the bit sequence: 001101. This is 13 in decimal Input #01: 100
Output #01: 27
Explanation: The bit sequence for 100 equals 1100100. Inverting the sequence we get 0011011 which is 27 in decimal.
